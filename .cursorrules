# KinCart Agent Rules

## Browser Testing
- ALWAYS use the following credentials from the `Makefile`:
  - Manager: `manager_test` (password: `pass1234`)
  - Shopper: `shopper_test` (password: `pass1234`)
- Do not use random login/passwords.
- Before testing, ensure you run `make seed-test-data` if the database is not initialized.

## Code Standards
- Follow the patterns in `backend/` and `frontend/`.
- Use Vanilla CSS for all styling.
- Ensure all new features are added to `development_plan.md`.
