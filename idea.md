# KinCart Concept

KinCart is an intelligent assistant for family shopping that connects users into "Families." Within a family, it supports role separation between a "Manager" (who plans) and a "Shopper" (who buys), minimizing time spent in the store and redundant back-and-forth messaging.

## Primary Workflow

**Intelligent Planning:** The planner can see past purchase history. Instead of typing text, they simply click on frequently purchased items (e.g., "Milk 2L"), and they are added to the current list. Users can create a new list from scratch or based on previous/template lists (Weekly Groceries, BBQ Party, etc.).

**Automatic Categorization:** The app, powered by AI or pre-defined dictionaries, instantly sorts items into groups: Fruits & Vegetables, Meat, Bakery, Household, etc.

**"In Store" Mode:** The shopper opens the list where items are already grouped by department. When an item is clicked, it is hidden or moved to the "In Cart" section, keeping the focus only on pending items.

## Additional Efficiency Features

### 1. Aisle Mapping (Route Optimization)
Allow users to configure the order of categories once for a specific supermarket (e.g., if your store starts with the vegetable department then bakery). The list will be organized in the logical sequence of movement through the store. A drag-and-drop interface is available in store settings to form the optimal route.

### 2. Item Details (Visual Cues)
The planner can attach a photo of a specific brand or packaging, as well as add a text description (e.g., "get exactly this one, do not take a substitute"). This eliminates the risk of the shopper picking the "wrong" laundry detergent or sauce. The image and description will be displayed next to the item in the list and reused for future purchases.

### 3. Budgeting
**Cost Estimation:** The app can automatically fetch prices and discounts from store websites.
**Receipt Archive:** The shopper can take a photo of the paper receipt after purchase, and price data will automatically update the information in the app for future planning.

### 4. "I Forgot!" Push Notifications
If the shopper has already started the shopping process, the manager can send an urgent addition. it will appear at the top of the shopper's screen with a bright orange "Urgent Addition!" label, ensuring important items aren't missed at the last moment.

### 5. Security and Family Access
The app requires authentication (login/password) for each user.
The application is built around the **Family** concept:
- One user creates a Family and invites other members.
- All family members have access to shared lists, purchase history, and store route settings.
- Any member can act as a Manager or Shopper for a specific purchase.
- Access is password-protected; data is isolated between different families.
- Data is available to all family devices and updates in real-time.

## Other Features

**Common Templates:** Creating ready-set lists for recurring scenarios (e.g., "BBQ Set" or "Weekly Restock").

**Bilingual Product Support:** To ensure the department grouping (dairy, meat, etc.) works effectively, a bilingual product database can be implemented for automatic matching (e.g., if "Mléko" is written, the app understands it is "Dairy").
